# Python Basics with Numpy (optional assignment)

Welcome to your first assignment. This exercise gives you a brief introduction to Python. Even if you've used Python before, this will help familiarize you with functions we'll need.  

**Instructions:**
- You will be using Python 3.
- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.
- Do not modify the (# GRADED FUNCTION [function name]) comment in some cells. Your work would not be graded if you change this. Each cell containing that comment should only contain one function.
- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.

**After this assignment you will:**
- Be able to use iPython Notebooks
- Be able to use numpy functions and numpy matrix/vector operations
- Understand the concept of "broadcasting"
- Be able to vectorize code

Let's get started!

## About iPython Notebooks ##

iPython Notebooks are interactive coding environments embedded in a webpage. You will be using iPython notebooks in this class. You only need to write code between the ### START CODE HERE ### and ### END CODE HERE ### comments. After writing your code, you can run the cell by either pressing "SHIFT"+"ENTER" or by clicking on "Run Cell" (denoted by a play symbol) in the upper bar of the notebook. 

We will often specify "(≈ X lines of code)" in the comments to tell you about how much code you need to write. It is just a rough estimate, so don't feel bad if your code is longer or shorter.

**Exercise**: Set test to `"Hello World"` in the cell below to print "Hello World" and run the two cells below.

```python
### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 1 line of code)
test = "Hello World";
### END CODE HERE ###
```
